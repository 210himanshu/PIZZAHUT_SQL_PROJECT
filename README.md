## ðŸ“Œ Overview

In todayâ€™s data-driven environment, businesses like PizzaHut need actionable insights from their data to stay competitive. This project uses structured SQL queries to explore and analyze pizza sales data, providing key business metrics such as revenue trends, top customers, and most popular items.

The project uses **MySQL** as the primary tool for querying and analysis. Queries are structured and optimized to reflect real-world business questions that can support data-driven decisions in a retail/food chain environment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze PizzaHutâ€™s sales data using SQL to extract meaningful business insights. The analysis covers key metrics such as total orders, total revenue, most ordered and highest-priced pizzas, popular sizes, and customer preferences. It also explores trends like order distribution by time, daily averages, revenue contribution by pizza types, and category-wise performance. The goal is to demonstrate the use of SQL for real-world data analysis and support data-driven decision-making.
The ultimate goal is to **transform raw data into meaningful insights** for decision-making.
